"""Steam reset planning and execution for the GUI.

Both steps read or delete large amounts of data, so they run off the UI
thread like the scan does. The keep-list is built into the program (see
``games.steam.default_keep``); the preview then lets the operator untick any
game, so a stray click cannot wipe a wanted title without it being seen.
