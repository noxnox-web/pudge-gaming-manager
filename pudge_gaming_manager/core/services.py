"""Application services: how the layers above ``core`` obtain working objects.

The GUI has no business opening a database or deciding where it lives. It
asks for a pipeline and gets one, fully wired. This keeps the storage
location, migration timing and connection lifetime inside ``core`` where
they belong — and keeps the ``app`` layer free of any ``database`` import,
which the architecture test enforces.
