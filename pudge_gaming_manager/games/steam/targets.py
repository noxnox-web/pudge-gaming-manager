"""One thing a Steam reset clears, and how it is cleared safely.

Three shapes cover everything the reset touches:

* ``TREE`` — a whole folder Steam recreates (``workshop``, ``appcache``...).
* ``CONTENTS`` — a folder emptied except for named files it must keep
  (``config`` keeps ``config.vdf``).
* ``FILE`` — a single file (a user's ``local.vdf`` sign-in tokens).

Every removal goes through ``utilities.secure_delete``: the target is opened
without following reparse points, so a junction planted in place of a cache
folder cannot redirect an elevated delete outside Steam's tree.
