"""The single place in Pudge Cleaner permitted to run external commands.

Rule #49: ``subprocess`` must not be scattered across the project. Every
external invocation goes through :class:`CommandRunner`, which guarantees a
timeout, captured output, a structured error, and an audit trail.
``tests/test_architecture.py`` fails the build if ``subprocess`` is imported
anywhere else.

Encoding note
-------------
Legacy Windows console programs (``powercfg``, ``sfc``, ``ipconfig``) write in
the OEM codepage, not UTF-8 — on a Russian-locale machine that is cp866.
Decoding those bytes as UTF-8 silently corrupts every non-ASCII value, which
would then be parsed into settings. The runner therefore captures *bytes* and
decodes through the OEM codepage reported by Windows itself.
