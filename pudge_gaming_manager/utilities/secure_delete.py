"""Deleting a file by the object, not by its name.

The cleaner runs elevated and deletes under ``C:\\Windows\\Temp``, a directory
any user can create subdirectories in. That is the classic setup for a
time-of-check/time-of-use attack: PGM validates a path, and between the
validation and the ``unlink`` a low-privileged user swaps a directory for a
junction pointing at ``System32``. The elevated delete then follows the
junction and destroys a system file.

Re-checking the path again just moves the window; the name is the wrong
thing to trust. This module opens a handle **once**, with
``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` so a reparse point is opened as itself
rather than followed, and does every check and the delete against that one
handle. After the open, the object is pinned: the attacker may rename or
replace the *name*, but the handle still refers to the object PGM inspected.

``delete_file`` is used for the actual removal. ``safe_unlink`` falls back to
an ordinary ``unlink`` off Windows (tests, and the rules never point outside
Windows in production), so the engine has one call site either way.
