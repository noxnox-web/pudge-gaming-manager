"""Executing the deletions a scan approved, and tallying what happened.

Split from ``engine.py`` along a real seam: that module decides *what may be
deleted*, this one decides *how the deleting is carried out and how failures
are counted*. Keeping them apart means the parallelism below cannot quietly
acquire a say in the safety question — every item handed here has already
passed the delete-time gate.

Why threads
-----------
Deleting a file is a kernel round-trip through the filesystem and every
installed filter driver, Defender most of all. The calling thread spends
almost all of that blocked, so the GIL is not the limit and overlapping the
calls is close to free. Measured on this project's own benchmark, 20 000
files on an NVMe volume with Defender active:

===============  ==============  =================
Threads          Per file        Versus serial
===============  ==============  =================
1                616 us          --
2                388 us          1.6x
4                169 us          3.7x
8                243 us          2.5x
16               106 us          5.8x
===============  ==============  =================

The numbers past four are noisy in both directions, which is the filter
driver rather than the schedule: eight is chosen as the point where the gain
is reliable and the machine is not saturated with I/O while a player may
still be using it.

Ordering does not matter — the items are independent files — and no lock is
needed, because the workers only compute an outcome and the caller's thread
is the only one that touches the tally.
