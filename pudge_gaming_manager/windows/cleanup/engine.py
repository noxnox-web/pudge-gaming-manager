"""The cleanup engine: scan, then delete only what the scan approved.

Flow (rule #9)::

    SCAN -> SHOW -> CONFIRM -> CLEAN -> VERIFY

``scan`` mutates nothing and produces a full inventory with sizes and
counts. ``clean`` deletes only paths that a scan already approved, and
re-checks every safety rule at deletion time rather than trusting the
inventory — the filesystem can change between the two.

Containment
-----------
Windows Temp commonly contains junctions and symlinks. Walking one without
resolving it would take the cleaner outside its sandbox, so every candidate
is resolved and re-tested for containment before it is touched. Directory
links are never descended into.
