"""What the cleaner is allowed to touch, and what it must never touch.

This module owns the *guards*. The catalogue of categories lives next door
in ``categories.py``; splitting them keeps each file reviewable and makes it
plain that adding a category cannot weaken a guard.

The cleaner cannot delete anything that is not described by a category, and
every category names explicit root directories resolved from environment
variables. There is no "scan the disk for junk" mode, because that is how a
cleaner deletes someone's save games.

Five independent safety layers
------------------------------
1. **Allowlisted roots.** Only the directories below are ever considered.
2. **Containment.** A candidate's *resolved* path must still sit inside its
   category root. Windows Temp routinely contains junctions, and following
   one without this check would walk the cleaner straight out of the
   sandbox.
3. **Protected paths.** Club software, launchers, anti-cheat and user
   documents are refused even if some future category points at them.
4. **Protected extensions.** Documents, saves and executables are refused
   inside temp folders. A category that exists precisely to remove the
   user's own files — the Downloads folder — waives this one by declaring
   ``clears_user_files``; credentials are refused even then.
5. **Minimum age.** Files younger than the category's threshold are left
   alone, because a file created seconds ago is probably open right now.

The root directory itself is never removed — only its contents.
