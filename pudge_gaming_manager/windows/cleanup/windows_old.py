"""Removing ``%SystemDrive%\\Windows.old`` after a Windows 11 upgrade.

A feature update leaves the previous install in ``Windows.old`` so the user
can roll back for ten days, after which Windows deletes it on its own. On a
club PC it is dead weight — often tens of gigabytes — and there is no reason
to keep the rollback.

It cannot be removed like an ordinary folder: many files are owned by
``TrustedInstaller`` and deny even administrators.

How it is removed, and why not ``takeown``/``icacls``
-------------------------------------------------------
This used to run ``takeown /r``, ``icacls /grant /t`` and ``rmdir /s``. Two
things were wrong with that.

**It reached outside the folder.** ``takeown /r`` and ``icacls /t`` walk
*into* directory junctions — verified on the development machine — and
``Windows.old`` contains them (``Documents and Settings``, ``Users\\All
Users`` and others), which can point at the *live* ``C:\\Users`` and
``C:\\ProgramData``. The elevated run could re-own and re-permission the
running system's user profiles.

**It was three passes over every file,** two of them rewriting a security
descriptor per file: 25 s for 20 000 files, against 1.7 s now.

Now the tree is deleted by handle with backup intent
(:func:`...utilities.tree_delete.delete_tree`): SeBackupPrivilege and
SeRestorePrivilege — which every administrator token holds, disabled — are
enabled for the duration, the documented way to delete regardless of a
file's ACL. No ownership or permission is changed anywhere, every child is
opened relative to its parent, and a link is deleted as a link.

Deleting it removes the ability to roll the Windows upgrade back. That is the
operator's decision, made at the preview; this module only carries it out.
