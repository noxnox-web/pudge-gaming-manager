"""Where the disk space went: a read-only survey of the largest folders.

This module deletes nothing and is allowed to look where the cleaner is
not. That is the point of it. The cleaner works from an allowlist precisely
so it can never delete something nobody listed; the cost of that discipline
is that it says nothing about the 200 GB sitting in a folder no category
names. This answers that question and leaves the decision to a person.

What it reports
---------------
Directories at a fixed depth below each root, with the recursive size of
each one's subtree. A fixed depth keeps the results disjoint — no directory
in the list can contain another — which is what makes the numbers add up
instead of double-counting a parent and its child.

Budgets, not promises
---------------------
Walking a full drive can take minutes. The survey stops at
``time_budget_s`` and says so, because a partial answer labelled partial is
useful and a GUI frozen for four minutes is not.
