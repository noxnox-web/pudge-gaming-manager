"""Frozen-executable entry point for Pudge Cleaner.

PyInstaller bundles this module rather than the package's ``__main__``, so
its relative imports do not have to be resolved from a frozen ``__main__``.

Setting ``PGM_SELFTEST=1`` constructs the dashboard off-screen, pumps the
event loop briefly and exits 0. It is how the build is smoke-tested without a
UAC prompt or a visible window: if a hidden import is missing, Qt fails to
load, or a module was left out of the bundle, this exits non-zero.
