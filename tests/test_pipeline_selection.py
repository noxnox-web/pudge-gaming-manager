"""Which tweaks an optimization pass offers, and why.

``build_tweaks`` is the selection step: it decides what the operator will be
shown before the engine applies any safety gate. These tests pin the two
changes that were made to it — cleanup is no longer conditional on disk
pressure, and the power-plan tweak is actually reachable.
